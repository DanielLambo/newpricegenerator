# This Arduino code interfaces with a Real-Time Clock (RTC) and a TFT display to monitor electricity prices based on the time of day. It uses an RGB LED to indicate whether the electricity price is low (green), medium (yellow), or high (red), based on data from a CSV format stored in the code. The system displays the current time, weather, electricity price, and advises the user on whether to use or turn off appliances depending on the price level. The weather and price information is updated every second and printed on the TFT screen, while the corresponding LED lights up to reflect the price tier.
